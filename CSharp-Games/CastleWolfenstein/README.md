Castle Wolfenstein
====
A C# implementation using Windows Forms of the popular 1981 computer game "Castle Wolfenstein".

Castle Wolfenstein combines adventure game elements with real-time action and is set in World War II. The game's main objective is to traverse the levels of the castle to find the secret war plans and escape alive. Progressively higher military ranks are earned upon each successful escape with the war plans, and the game becomes correspondingly more difficult as each higher rank is achieved. The game is played from a top-down perspective, though the characters are seen upright like in a side-scroller. The player traverses the levels by sneaking past guards, impersonating Nazi soldiers and sometimes even killing opponents.

Castle Wolfenstein was originally developed by Muse Software for the Apple II and was created by Silas Warner.
